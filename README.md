# Degrees That Pay Back :mortar_board:
This is Project 3- Single-Theme Portfolio Data Visualization Package for *JOUR 5380E*.
## Project Pitch :loudspeaker:
###### Description
For my final project, I would like to explore post-college salaries. People’s starting salaries will be different depending on what type of school they attend and what they studied. This topic interests me mainly because it’s relevant to me and my peers. As a college student myself, I’m curious to see which degrees have the best return of investment and which ones have greater potential/growth in salary over time. The target audience for my graphic would most likely be college students, people who are preparing to go to college, or even people who have recently graduated from college.
###### Data Source
I plan to collect my data from *The Wall Street Journal* (based from *Payscale, Inc.*). There are three datasets I would like to focus on which are: **Salary Increase by Type of College**, **Salaries by Region**, and **Salary Increase by Major**. I’ve downloaded the data in the form of CSV files. Setting up the data, I found that there are a couple of duplicates found in the **Type of College** dataset. There are also some missing values in each of the three datasets. Consequently, I’ll have to clean the data by removing null values and filtering to keep unique values.
###### Main Visualization Components
Regarding visualization techniques, I plan to use a stacked bar graph to compare the starting salary and mid-career salary based on each listed major. For my second visual, I plan to use a merged scatter-boxplot to compare starting salary and mid-career salary based on school type (i.e. Ivy League, Engineering, Liberal Arts, Party, State). For my third visual, I plan to use another scatter-boxplot to compare starting salary and mid-career salary based on region (California, Northeastern, Southern, Western, and Midwestern).
###### Overall Layout Sketch
I plan to have my written analysis/observations below each graph. For the **Salaries by Region** graph, I’ve also been considering making a map chart instead.
